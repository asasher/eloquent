# Eloquent

One installable career-development skill for AI coding agents. It turns career material into clear, persuasive resumes, CVs, profiles, letters, interview stories, and negotiation scripts through a single entry point, `eloquent`.

## Structure

```text
skills/eloquent/
+-- SKILL.md
+-- agents/
|   `-- openai.yaml
+-- reference/
|   +-- ats.md
|   +-- bullets.md
|   `-- ...
`-- scripts/
    `-- command-metadata.json
```

`SKILL.md` is the only trigger surface. The detailed workflows live in `reference/` and are loaded only when the matching subcommand is used.

## Install

Install globally:

```bash
npx skills add asasher/eloquent -g -y
```

Install in the current project:

```bash
npx skills add asasher/eloquent -y
```

## Usage

Invoke the single skill directly or ask naturally:

```text
eloquent ats
eloquent bullets
eloquent analyze-job
eloquent tailor
eloquent cover-letter
eloquent interview
eloquent salary
```

Natural requests route to the nearest subcommand:

```text
"Optimize this resume for ATS."
"Rewrite these bullets for a senior product role."
"Here is a job description and my resume. Should I apply?"
"Tailor my resume for this posting."
"Write a cover letter for this role."
```

## Design

The skill follows the same broad shape as `impeccable`: one entrypoint, a command table, routing rules, detailed command references, and command metadata. This keeps activation predictable and avoids installing twenty separate skills for related resume workflows.
